# Changes, Tests, and Enhancements

---

## Changes Made (What & Why)

### detector.py + main.py + frontend — Auth confidence score (implemented)
- **What:** Added `auth_confidence` (0-100) to the detection output, API response, and frontend result cards.
- **How it works:** Score is computed from deterministic signals: password field presence, username/email signals, submit signals, and auth-related keywords in nearby form text/attributes.
- **Why:** Helps distinguish true login forms from lookalike inputs (newsletter/search/simple forms) and gives users a measurable confidence level.

### scraper.py + main.py + frontend — Screenshot capture (implemented)
- **What:** Added Playwright screenshot capture and returned it as `screenshot_base64` in `POST /scrape`.
- **How it works:** Capture priority is: password form crop → first form crop → viewport fallback.
- **Why:** Lets users visually validate what form was analyzed, not just trust raw HTML and text analysis.

### frontend/app.js — Search-result URL warning popup (implemented)
- **What:** Added a popup that warns when the user pastes a search-engine wrapper URL instead of a direct target page.
- **How it works:** The frontend checks common search engine query params (`q`, `url`, `u`) and shows a contextual error popup with the extracted target URL when possible.
- **Why:** Prevents confusing false negatives like scraping Google search results instead of the actual login page.

### backend/main.py + frontend/index.html + frontend/app.js — Backend login gate (implemented)
- **What:** Added a full-screen login page before the dashboard loads, but the credentials are verified by the backend.
- **How it works:** The frontend sends the access ID/password to `POST /auth/login`; the backend checks `FRONTEND_LOGIN_ID` / `FRONTEND_LOGIN_PASSWORD` and returns an opaque session token that the frontend stores for later requests.
- **Why:** Keeps the dashboard hidden until authenticated without exposing the login credentials in frontend config files.

### backend/main.py — LLM outage fallback mode (implemented)
- **What:** Changed `/scrape` behavior so LLM errors no longer fail the whole request.
- **How it works:** On `LLMError`, backend returns deterministic output with `analysis_mode = rules`, `llm_fallback_reason`, and zero token usage.
- **Why:** Detection reliability is the primary goal; LLM outages/rate limits should not block core scraping results.

### frontend/index.html + frontend/app.js + frontend/style.css — Session UX additions (implemented)
- **What:** Added Logout button, analysis-mode badge, and Render cold-start toast.
- **How it works:** Logout clears local session token and restores login gate; badge shows `LLM` vs `Rules Fallback`; toast appears only during slow first-request wake-up behavior.
- **Why:** Improves user trust and clarity during session state changes and free-tier cold starts.

### scraper.py + frontend/app.js — Browser challenge detection (implemented)
- **What:** Added structured detection for browser-check / anti-bot interstitials such as WordPress/Cloudflare verification pages.
- **How it works:** If Playwright or requests returns challenge text like `Checking your browser`, `Secured by wp.com`, or `Cloudflare`, backend raises `SCRAPE_BOT_CHALLENGE` and frontend shows a warning modal.
- **Why:** Prevents false `No Auth Form Detected` results when the real problem is bot verification, not missing auth.

### llm.py — Improved prompt + increased snippet limit
- **What:** Updated `_build_prompt()` to ask for 4-5 sentences covering 5 specific categories: form type, input fields, alternative login methods (QR/passkey/SSO/OAuth), security features (CAPTCHA/CSRF/WebAuthn/remember me), and UX details (forgot password, register link, required field markers).
- **Why:** Old prompt asked for 2-3 sentences and only mentioned "notable features" vaguely — missed QR code login on Discord, passkey buttons, WebAuthn hints, register links. Now every feature in the HTML is explicitly asked for.
- **Also:** Increased snippet char limit from 3000 → 6000. Discord's form is 40,000 chars — the QR code section was beyond the old 3000 char cutoff and never reached the LLM.

### detector.py — Broadened password field detection
- **What:** Was only matching `<input type="password">`. Now also matches inputs where `name`, `aria-label`, `placeholder`, `id`, or `autocomplete` contains "password".
- **Why:** Demo and real sites sometimes use `type="text"` for the password field (e.g. `web-scraping.dev/login`). The old detector returned `auth_found: false` for these.
- **Also:** `_extract_field_types()` now labels these as "password" instead of "text".

### llm.py — Model corrections
- **Ollama:** Changed from `llama3.1:8b` → `gemma4:e4b` → `gemma3:4b` (first two don't exist on Ollama Cloud; confirmed by listing account's available models live).
- **OpenAI:** Changed from `gpt-4o-mini` → `gpt-4.1-mini` (project does not have access to `gpt-4o-mini`; listed available models to confirm).
- **Gemini:** Changed from `gemini-1.5-flash` → `gemini-2.0-flash` → `gemini-2.5-flash` (older models deprecated; correct ID found by calling `genai.list_models()`).

### Docker — Base image changed
- **What:** Changed from `python:3.12-slim` with manual Playwright install to `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.48.0-jammy`.
- **Why:** Debian trixie renamed `ttf-unifont` — the manual install path broke. Official image has everything pre-installed.

### main.py — load_dotenv() added
- **What:** Added `load_dotenv()` at top of `main.py`.
- **Why:** Without it, `.env` is only loaded if uvicorn is started from the project root. Adding it makes env vars load regardless of working directory.

### Anthropic removed, Ollama added
- **What:** Removed Anthropic provider, added Ollama Cloud.
- **Why:** Anthropic trial credits exhausted. Ollama Cloud provides a paid API using the same key format.

## Tests We Cover

All tests in `backend/tests/` are mocked — no real network or API calls required.

### test_scraper.py
- `test_fetch_returns_html` — requests returns valid HTML
- `test_raises_scraper_error_on_timeout` — Timeout → ScraperError with `SCRAPE_TIMEOUT`
- `test_raises_scraper_error_on_connection_error` — DNS/network fail → `SCRAPE_DNS_FAIL`
- `test_raises_scraper_error_on_403` — Blocked → `SCRAPE_BLOCKED`
- `test_raises_scraper_error_on_404` — Not found → `SCRAPE_NOT_FOUND`
- `test_uses_playwright_when_html_too_short` — requests returns < 500 chars → Playwright fallback triggered
- `test_uses_requests_when_html_is_sufficient` — requests returns > 500 chars → Playwright NOT called
- `test_fetch_html_returns_screenshot_when_available` — screenshot is returned in the third tuple value

## What We Have Not Tested (Gaps)

- Playwright screenshot correctness is tested with mocks, not pixel/assertion-level E2E verification
- Confidence scoring boundaries are covered for common cases, but not yet calibrated against a large labeled dataset
- Ollama/Gemini/OpenAI error paths tested via mocks but not live API errors
- No browser-level UI test currently validates confidence bar rendering + screenshot visibility states together

## Possible Enhancements

### Functional
- **Batch URL scraping** — accept a list of URLs in one request, return results for all
- **Field-level detail** — return validation rules, required/optional, max length per field
- **Multi-form detection** — some pages have both login and signup forms; detect and return both

### Reliability
- **Retry logic** — auto-retry scrape once on transient errors (timeout, 429, 5xx)
- **Rate limit queue** — queue requests per provider so you never hit RPM limit
- **User-agent rotation** — cycle through browser user-agents to reduce blocking

### UX / UI
- **History panel** — show last N scraped URLs with results cached in localStorage
- **Copy button** — one-click copy for HTML snippet or LLM analysis
- **Dark mode** — CSS variable-based theme toggle
- **Export to JSON** — download full result as a `.json` file

### Deployment
- **Deploy backend** — Render or Railway (backend is already Dockerized, one-click deploy)
- **Deploy frontend** — Vercel or GitHub Pages (static HTML, zero config)
- **Environment check endpoint** — `GET /config` that shows which providers are configured without exposing keys

### Observability
- **Request logging** — log each scrape: URL, provider, tokens used, scrape method, duration
- **Error rate tracking** — count errors by type so you can see which provider fails most
